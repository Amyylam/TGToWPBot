All rights reserved for my codes written to intergrate a few APIs and conversation flow design of the Telegram bot. 
Copyright of Telegram-python-bot Python package, Wordpress API and Imgur API that I called in the Python script belong to their original authors.

This piece of code is an integration of a few REST APIs from different SaaS platforms to faciliate posting from Telegram to WordPress. During my research online and brief search in WordPress.com plug-ins, I feel there's no tool that can do exactly what I wish to do (post from Telegram to WordPress, not the other way round; I can see quite a lot of plug-ins are doing posting from WordPress to Telegram), except one that is commercial and paid SaaS solution (which I could not proof whether it can really do TG-WP posting in both directions as I didn't pay). Therefore, I would like to preserve the right to commercialize this tool, if it's really a unique integration solution upon further research.
